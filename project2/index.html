        <br>


        <p>IN STUART EWEN’S ALL CONSUMING IMAGES: THE POLITICS OF STYLE IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE, HE DIVES INTO THE IMPORTANCE OF ADVERTISING AND BRANDING IN OUR CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY. DESIGN MANIPULATES OUR MIND AND TOYS WITH HUMAN EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS WHY ADVERTISING INVOLVES DENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGY.</p> 
        
        <p>BECAUSE MANY AMERICANS ARE BROUGHT UP IN A MARKETING-HEAVY ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY IN AGE WHEN SMART DEVICES ARE HANDED TO US AT A YOUNGER AGE, WE CAN NO LONGER TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE NEEDS IN TERMS OF JUST FEELING CONTENT WITH OUR STATE OF LIVING OR BASIC NEEDS FOR SURVIVAL, ENVIRONMENTALLY AND SOCIALLY. SINCE THE TRUE NEED ITSELF IS UNCLEAR, WE MUST ASK OURSELVES...</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>Are we Okay with Companies Having Such a Heavy Influence From the Bottom up on our Mindsets Or is it Just out of Our Control?</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>THE IDEA OF HAVING TRUE AND FALSE NEEDS CAME FROM MARCUSE’S ONE DIMENSIONAL MAN WHICH COMPARES HISTORIC HUMAN NEEDS TO TODAY’S SOCIETAL DEMANDS FOR SURVIVAL. BECAUSE EVERYTHING, FROM THE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATED INTO OUR LIFESTYLES TO THE JOBS WE CHOOSE TO MAKE MONEY, HAS POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS, WE’VE LOST OUR FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT AND PURPOSE TO LIFE.</p>
            
        <p>WITH EVERYTHING DESIGNED BY PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY HAVE POLITICAL POWER AND A MONEY-DRIVEN MINDSET, INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BORN INTO A CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY END UP MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT IS ALREADY PROVIDED AND CONSTRUCTED AROUND US. THE AMERICAN SOCIAL STRUCTURE HAS THE MISSION OF SWAYING INTENTIONAL OUTCOMES FROM INDIVIDUALS, WHICH WE DON’T HAVE CONTROL OVER.</p>
            
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>Is It Ethical To Give Up Our Freedom And Privacy So That Corporations Build Who We Are As A Person From The Ground Up?</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>WITH OUR CURRENT SYSTEM, COMPANIES FEED US KNOWLEDGE AND BRIBE US WITH NEW TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTS SO WE FEEL OUR TEMPORARY HAPPINESS, EVEN THOUGH THEY’RE THE ONES TAKING AWAY PEOPLE’S CREATIVE AUTONOMY WITH THEIR MUNDANE OCCUPATIONS. THAT’S WHY PEOPLE MUST IDENTIFY WHAT A TRUE AND FALSE NEED IS FOR THEMSELVES. THE RAW DEFINITION OF A TRUE NEED HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY MANIPULATED OVER THE YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS SOCIAL NORMS CHANGE.</p>
        
        <p>INDIVIDUAL SELLERS GROWING AND CORPORATE COMPANIES FORMING, PEOPLE HAVE BUILT AND DESIGNED THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY. BUSINESSES SHAPE OUR COUNTRY PHYSICALLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE FUNCTION DAILY TO HOW POLITICIANS DECIDE TO REGULATE INDIVIDUAL AND COMPANY BEHAVIORS. WITH THIS BEING THE CASE...</p>
            
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>Are we Surprised By Advertisements Influencing Consumer Behavior? </h1></marquee>
        
        <p>WHILE STUDYING BEHAVIOR, PSYCHOLOGISTS RESEARCHED THE IMPACT OF NATURE VERSUS NURTURE DURING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. SINCE WE’RE LOOKING INTO THE EFFECTS OF IMAGES DISPLAYED FROM MARKETING, THE MAIN TWO CONCEPTS ARE HUMANISM AND BEHAVIORISM.</p>
	   
        <p>WHEN MAKING PURCHASES, WE NATURALLY CHOOSE WHAT IS FAMILIAR. A NAME WE’VE SEEN OR HEARD, EVEN IF WE DON’T RECALL FROM WHERE, THAT NAME WILL POP INTO OUR MINDS AND BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHAT WE SPEND OUR MONEY ON. </p>
            
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>when we are Overloaded with A Constant Stream of Brand Names since birth, it Becomes hard to Tell If the choice to Purchase is being Made of Our own Volition or if it is being Made for us in the Form of Repetitive Brainwashing.</h1></marquee>
            
        <p>IN SCHWARTZ’S THE PARADOX OF CHOICE: WHY MORE IS LESS, HE MENTIONS THAT ITEMS THAT ARE NONDURABLE REQUIRE LESS OF AN EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT WHICH HELPS TO MAKE THE WRONG DECISIONS LESS PAINFUL. HOWEVER, WITH OBJECTS WE BUY INTO THAT ARE MEANT TO LAST LONGER, OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL STAKES RISE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE CHOOSE FROM.</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>Companies That Have Strong Advertising Campaigns Break Their Way Into The Forefront Of Our Society.</h1></marquee>
            
        <p>BRANDS LIKE TIDE, CHEERIOS, AND COCA COLA HAVE KEPT UP A STEADY CAMPAIGN FOR DECADES AND FOR MANY THEY ARE THE DEFAULT OPTION. LARGE PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WILL EVEN REFER TO ALL SODAS UNDER THE GENERAL NAME ‘COKE’ BECAUSE OF COCA COLA’S INFLUENCE.</p>
       
        <p>THESE SAME COMPANIES AND ADVERTISING POWERHOUSES HAVE IN A SENSE NURTURED OUR SOCIETY TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE ACCEPTED THEM AS STAPLES OF IT, AND AS WE EVOLVE, SO DO THEY.COMPANIES PRESENT THEMSELVES IN A VERY CALCULATED WAY WHEN ADVERTISING.</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1> Whether Or Not You Are Able To Sense It, There Is Always An Agenda And Intention Behind Their Words.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>IT’S NOT JUST GETTING YOU TO BUY THEIR PRODUCT, BUT ALSO BUY INTO THEM AND THEIR CURATED BRAND. FROM MARX’S PERSPECTIVE, “VALUE, DOES NOT STALK ABOUT WITH A LABEL DESCRIBING WHAT IT IS.</p>
        
        <p>IT IS THE VALUE, RATHER, THAT COVERTS EVERY PRODUCT INTO A SOCIAL HIEROGLYPHIC.”  BEING SO REMOVED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PURCHASE, WE BELIEVE IN ITS VALUE BASED ON HOW COMPANIES DECIDE TO PRICE THINGS AND ELEVATE THEIR VALUE THROUGH SOCIAL EFFORTS.</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>Since The Introduction Of Social Media, The Advertising World Has Been Turned On Its Head.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>BILLBOARDS AND POSTED SIGNS ARE OVER. WHY? BECAUSE EVERYONE IS STARING AT THEIR PHONES. INSTEAD OF MASSIVE ADS THAT HANG OVER US, THEY NOW LAY NESTLED BETWEEN PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. WE FOLLOW THE PEOPLE WE ASPIRE TO BE AND ADVERTISEMENTS WITH THE SAME AESTHETIC OR VALUES EMERGE SECONDS AFTER YOU THINK ABOUT IT.</p>
        
        <p>BY BUYING INTO THESE MARKETING STRATEGIES, WE’RE PROVING TO COMPANIES THAT THEY’RE RIGHT AND THEY KNOW WHAT’S BEST FOR US. DOES THAT QUALIFY THEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE? WITHOUT ANY ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OF COMPANIES THAT CAN PROVIDE US WITH A FULLY ETHICAL PRODUCT WHILE SURVIVING A CAPITALISTIC BUSINESS MODEL, WE’RE ACCEPTING THE WORTH OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BECAUSE WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE TO REFER TO?</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>The Transformation Of Online Ads, From Annoying Sidebars To Nearly Undetectable, Sponsored Posts Is A Smart Move On The Part Of Advertisers.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO NUDGE HUMANS INTO BUYING THINGS THEY KNOW WE WILL LIKE BY TRACKING US ONLINE AND FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT OUR PERSONALITIES. TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, A PERSON LOOKING THROUGH THE EXPLORE PAGE ON INSTAGRAM. MAYBE THEY LOOK AT A FEW POSTS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND THEN RESUME THEIR NORMAL FEED SCROLLING.</p>
        
        <p>BEFORE THEY KNOW IT AN AD FOR REUSABLE STRAWS POPS UP, RATHER THAN IGNORING THE INVASIVE AD, THEY DECIDE IT’S AN ACTION THEY SHOULD TAKE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE SUSTAINABILITY POSTS AND CLICK ON IT. TRACKING OUR BEHAVIORS, COMPANIES CAN NOW TELL NOT JUST WHO WE ARE, BUT THE PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO BE. THEY THEN USE THIS DATA TO GET US TO BUY THINGS THAT WE CAN MORE EASILY JUSTIFY PURCHASING, MAKING IT SO MUCH MORE EASY FOR THEM.</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"> <h1>But We Have To Keep In Mind That These Choices Aren’t Fully Ours Even If We Are The Ones Clicking The Purchase Button.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>WHEN COMPANIES TRACK OUR BEHAVIORS, THIS CROSSES A LINE INTO THEM BEING ABLE TO DICTATE WHAT WE BUY. IT’S DIFFERENT FROM OLD STYLES OF ADVERTISEMENT WHICH FELT MORE LIKE A SUGGESTION. WITH THE FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM AD ALGORITHMS, REPETITIVE ADS CAN EVEN SEEM LIKE A SIGN UNTIL A PERSON IS WORN DOWN ENOUGH TO SUBMIT AND PURCHASE THE ITEM THEY HAVE BEEN FED IMAGES OF.</p>
        
        <p>THE ACTION OF TRACKING IS OFTEN JUSTIFIED BY THE VERY SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS WE USE AS A WAY TO GIVE US MORE ADS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US. THEY PRESENT IT AS IF IT IS A FAVOR AND THEY ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL TOWARDS US, AND EVEN THOUGH SOCIETY IS LARGELY SKEPTICAL OF THE ACT...</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>The Human Response Often Manifests As Jokes Rather Than Outrage.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>WE SEE OFTEN PEOPLE TALKING ONLINE ABOUT HOW THEY’VE SAID A WORD TO THEIR PHONE AND THEN SEEN AN AD LATER ON ABOUT IT. OFTEN THERE WILL BE JOKES ABOUT THE PHONE LISTENING IN, BUT NO LARGER ACTION SEEMS TO EVER BE TAKEN AND NO FURTHER THOUGHT PUT INTO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE BEING LISTENED TO, WITHOUT REALLY FULLY CONSENTING. INSTEAD, SOCIETY SUBMITS TO THE SYSTEMATIC BUGGING THAT IS INHERENT IN SOCIAL MEDIA. THE APPS MAY BE FREE, BUT THE REAL PRICE IS OUR PRIVACY AND DATA.</p>

        <p>NOW INSTEAD OF JUST BUYING WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE, WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A PLETHORA OF THINGS TO DO, PLACES TO GO, AND ITEMS TO BUY THAT ALL FIT OUR PERSONALITY. IT IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO ESCAPE ADS AS THEY BECOME LESS VISIBLE AND FEEL MORE NATURAL. ACCORDING TO EWEN, “ADMEN SPOKE IN SPECIFIC TERM OF HUMAN INSTINCTS WHICH IF PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD COULD INDUCE PEOPLE TO BUY A GIVEN PRODUCT IF IT WAS SCIENTIFICALLY PRESENTED.”</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>In Response, Brands Are Trying To Add An Element Of Nature Back Into Products To Push Feel Of Survival Or “true” Needs, Whether It Be More Emotional Than Physical, From Our Wants.</h1></marquee>
            
        <p>TAKE FOOD PRODUCTS AS AN EXAMPLE; CHEERIOS CLAIM THAT THEIR PRODUCTS LOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL BY 4% IN 6 WEEKS. WHO WOULDN’T WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH WHILE EATING SOMETHING DELICIOUS? TRACKED AND SPONSORED POSTS ARE ONE LEVEL, BUT THE INFLUENCER INDUSTRY HAS TIPPED US OVER THE EDGE.</p>

        <p>THE PEOPLE WE FOLLOW AND TRUST IN THESE APPS ARE OFTEN BOUGHT BY THE COMPANIES TO DO THEIR ADVERTISING FOR THEM. INFLUENCERS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN CONTRACTED ADVERTISERS, PAID BY COMPANIES TO PUSH MORE PRODUCTS ONTO PEOPLE, PRODUCTS THAT THEY PROBABLY DON’T EVEN USE.</p>
        
        <p>WHILE LARGER INFLUENCERS LIKE THE KARDASHIANS ARE OPEN ABOUT THEIR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMPANIES AND PRESENT THEIR ADS WITH THE PROPER #AD SIGNIFIER, SMALLER INFLUENCERS AREN’T LOOKED AT WITH THE SAME SCRUTINY AND CAN GET AWAY WITH FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR PARTNERSHIPS AND PUSHING PRODUCTS THAT THEY ARE PAID.</p>
            
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>Followers Become Subject To Advertising Without Even Being Aware Of It And Fall For Claims, Scientific Or Not, They Are Told To Use.</h1></marquee>

        <p>AS THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY FINDS NEW WAYS TO REACH CONSUMERS, EACH STEP FURTHER THEY TAKE BRINGS US INTO MORE DANGEROUS TERRITORY. WE ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL TO SEE THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR PAID CAMPAIGNS, AND THEIR SOCIETAL TAKEOVER IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.</p>
        
        <p>BORN INTO AN ENVIRONMENT, CRAMMED WITH VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS EVERYWHERE WE LOOK, PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY ADOLESCENTS, LIVE UNDER SOCIAL PRESSURES THAT LEAD TO HIGH PERSONAL EXPECTATIONS AND MAYBE EVEN DEPRESSION. EVEN EWEN EXPRESSED THAT “ADVERTISING HOPED TO ELICIT THE INSTINCTUAL ANXIETIES OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.”</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>How are Teens who Invest in Their Smartphones and Still Mentally Developing Know Any Better Than to Believe What Brands Have Purposefully put Out that Causes their Distress?</h1></marquee>

        <br>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>We Yearn For Something Real, But we Don’t Know what To Trust.</h1></marquee>

        <p>OVER THE YEARS, ADVERTISING STRATEGIES HAVE EVOLVED, BUT THE PROMINENT MESSAGE REMAINS THE SAME. WHILE WE DO SEE IMPROVEMENTS FOR BODY POSITIVITY AND OVERALL HEALTH, SUCH AS THE DOVE REAL BEAUTY CAMPAIGN, MAJOR COMPANIES ARE STILL DEFINING WHAT BEAUTY AND COOLNESS MEAN.</p>
        
        <p>NOW PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST AND BUY THEIR WAY IN TO FIT THOSE BEAUTY STANDARDS AND ADAPT THEIR BODIES OR LIFESTYLES BASED ON THE CONSTANT REMINDER OF WHAT’S “HOT”. A COMMON TOPIC FOR DEBATE. IN A WORLD OF MASS MARKETING, WE ARE BORN TO SELL OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO COMPANIES BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW IT.</p>
        
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>As The world Continues To Urbanize, the Further Humans Become Separated From Nature to the Point When we Might Not Know what’s Natural Anymore.</h1></marquee>
        
        <p>INSTEAD, ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE ARE INCORPORATED INTO VISUAL CAMPAIGNS. RATHER THAN LEARNING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS ARE FOR OURSELVES, WE ARE INSTRUCTED BY SUBTLE ADVERTISEMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR DAY AND MAYBE EVEN LIFETIME.</p>

        <p>FROM THE BIRTH OF ADVERTISING, OUR SOCIETY HAS NORMALIZED SHOPPING WHICH HAS HAD A NEGATIVE AND QUESTIONABLY UNETHICAL IMPACT CAUSED BY TECHNOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE. THIS HAS LEAD TO DISTORTING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A TRUE AND FALSE NEED FROM A YOUNG AGE AS WE GROW UP WITH DECREASED INTELLECTUAL OR IMAGINATIVE FREEDOM.</p>
        
         <p>YES, TECHNOLOGY BENEFITS US IN MANY WAYS, BUT THE COMPANIES BEHIND OUR DAILY CHOICES HAVE ALREADY MADE THEM FOR US, RESULTING IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL MAN OR WOMAN WITH SIMILAR NEEDS. WHILE WE DO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHICH BRANDS WE WANT TO SUPPORT, COMPANIES WITH POLITICAL POWER BACKING THEM UP ARE THE ONES WHO WILL SURVIVE AND THE ONES PEOPLE DEPEND ON.</p> 
             
        <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left"><h1>It’s Clear How Heavily Influenced we Are By brand advertisements Defining what Our True needs are to Sustain a Happy and Healthy Lifestyle.</h1></marquee>
