		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>Material design encompasses environment, nagivation, typography and much more. On the topic of environment, the article says material doesn't move like gas or liquid. Looking at the video displays, I'm wondering why not? Is it more of a style preference or a rule of thumb for good design? I can agree that <q>Material enters and exits through changes in opacity, size, or position</q>, but I also kind of like the look of the fluidity of the material.</p>
        
        <p>Another important aspect of material design that I often forget about is how colors can show heirarchy. Seems obvious but sometimes I end up designing something that I think looks good but doesn't have good UI for the end user. Colors create elevation which I didn't associate with 2D designs/screens before. Motion and shadows work together and are an important aspect of a person's UX.</p>
