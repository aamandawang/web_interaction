        <p>I think it's funny to think about how all forms of art are not JPG's. Whether it was created digitally or physically like a sculpture/painting, it end's up being photographed and put onto a website of some sort. The article talks about the blogger template and how it categorizes work by date or tags , which is pretty boring. I like the point of considering where you host your work as a exhibition space. You have to look at the space, the lighting, the cost, and probably more.</p>
        
        <p>The stat about how many images are uploaded to the web per minute doesn't surprise me. It does feel like a lot of work we see nowadays are pulled from what we find online. Thought it was funny how Tumblr and blogging layouts have changed digital culture so much. Do you think there will be a lacklash with how people layout or make their websites? Will themes and traditional templates die?
