        <p>Meme's are everywhere! And honestly anything can be turned into a meme these days. I feel like I'm one to be late too all the jokes but does that mean I'm just caught up on news since they're all intertwined now? It seems like people aren't in favor of the political climate right now (I mean who is) so making a meme out of it is the best way to get people's attention and start a discussion. Frontline memes trend and honestly bring people together. Since there are so many mediums for communication now, thinking about social media in particular, designers need to take into account the different formats and the lifespan of the content. Messaging has become so immediate that there's always a new one in the making, but I guess that's how fast political news go around too!</p>
