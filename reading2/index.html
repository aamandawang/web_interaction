		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>After reading this article, it was reassuring to understand how a computer transplates coding language through visual tree diagrams. One path leads to another and everything lives in a container that becomes a possible path. That makes every bracket crucial or else the computer doesn't see the code as a complete path and won't go in that direction. It's all the hype now to learn how to code, but people are in a way coding without even realizing it. Feeding the computer information, like in excel, is forcing it to compute the desired outcome. People just don't think about it that much because on the interface we're used to that engineers have built. That's the difference between front and back end developers I guess! 
        </p>	
       
        <p>Next, the hot topic of algorithms was an intersting topic to cover. It's funny because I hear people talk about how to <q>beat</q> social media algorithms, so in general people have an understanding that someone decided that specific interactions lead to specific outcomes. After all, algorithms are functions so number of likes or interactions do matter! What kind of people create these algorithms? With more objects becoming automated, it's a huge issue that a majority of the coders making the big decisions are men. No one can deny that AI has bias; just look at your gmail auto-responses.

        <p>Moving along this long article, it covers the different languages code covers. From C++ to Javascript, each language is used for different purposes. This makes me wonder if a new language is being developed as I read this article. What I thought was funny was how code can have personalities too, like the programmers who use it. People can have their preferences, but of course that can only happen if you have the option to choose, meaning if you know the language. Along with preferences, people have their own styles of writing code &#40;not just to design the user interface&#41;.
