		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>Talic is a word I would've never thought of when describing the web. It's neither positive nor negative in my opintion. It means having a purpose or end but it's not guaranteeing an specific outcome. But because there's no specific taste / it's an <q>open source</q>, the opportunities are endless.

        <p>Then the author goes to talk about Neen. A part of me was wondering if this term and meaning was made up. When I looked up Neen for myself, it said it was a village in Europe, not a <q>frame of mind</q>. But I guess Neenstars aren't overthinkers which is why they're such great creators. I love that they seem silly because it's easy and amazing. I can already think of people I know who fit in this frame of mind. Then together, Neens and Talic spirits have a unique relationship with the world and the materials they use to create art, or whatever they choose to work on.
