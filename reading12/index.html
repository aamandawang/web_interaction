		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p><q>Software grows until it exceeds our capacity to understand it</q> just gave me the shiverrs. Now it just feels like we're consitantly battling between ethics and advanced technology. The moment even the smartest people can't understand the software we use, will there be war with the technology itself or will we fight with each other. It feels like politics is already forcing people further apart and they should definitely not be the ones regulating the technology they barely know about. It feel like we're constantly fighting what should be done like work that makes us happy and helps others versus what we need to do to survive in the society designed today. Everything annoyingly revolves arond money so doing good isn't always possible. It feels like we're stuck with what we have!</p>
