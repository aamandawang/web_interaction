		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>A problem of luxury is an interesting topic. At Parsons, BBA students are constantly assigned to research complex design problems because I guess essentially everything is designed. Systems, looks, products. The list goes on. Because of this, it's true that we have to question what kind of problems we're actually facing. Can design problems with both aesthetic and scientific? Social and scientific? Or all three? 
        </p>
        <p>As more technological and political arise, people are now more aware of the importance of visual/graphic design. There's graphic design involved in sciences, social studies, everything! It's crazy to believe that graphic desingers were once a profession that was looked down on. Finally people see designers as something more meaningful than just making things look pretty. Designers now have so many roles in society that it's hard to define.</p>
