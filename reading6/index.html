        <p>It's fun to think about a low quality image as representing it's visability. The more downloads, uploads, and edits, the more pixelated it becomes on the web which is kinda beautiful. Strange to think about how low quality images are almost desired now. I see people purposfully lowering the qualiry for an aesthetic or they'll just use a vintage camera for a grained effect.

	    <p>People find ways to share files now. If a site doesn't allow you to save a file, there are loopholes like screenshotting or screen recordings. That's the reality of it; that's the reality of the afterlife for an original piece. While companies are always striving for the highest quality and edits of an image to show hierarchy, it's fun to see how our newer technology allows us to alter these images to bring more value to it, and not to degrade it because it's lower quality.
