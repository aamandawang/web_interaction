		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>Apple has definitely created visual expectations users have when interacting with a mobile or desktop flatform. With the layout, color, animations, they've manged to formulate a bible based on their own user research. To say the least, Apple's UI is extremely satisfying and translates everything they want to communicate well, but using this as a bible has led to so many designs to look the same. It makes me wonder if this is it when it comes to universally accepted design.
