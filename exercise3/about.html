                <h1>— ABOUT —</h1>
                <p>Hey guys! I'm Amanda and I'm a 21-year-old &#40; turning 22 on September 25th - yay &#41; derp from Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, I moved to NYC to attend Parsons School of Design to recieve a Bachelor of Business Administration by May of 2020. I quickly realized that my major, while very useful, didn't have many design courses that involved using Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
                <p>Just two semesters ago, I started gravitating towards digital design which is when I declared my minor in Communication Design. I hope to employ my skills at a company that realizes the importance of corporate shared values to not only benefit business but also social or environmental issues. As cheesy as this sounds, I desire to be a part of something big and work with people who aren’t afraid of pushing boundaries through design research. I’m drawn to the integration of business strategy and the implementation of human-centered design in branding as well as product management. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I guess we'll see where the world takes me! Coming into Parsons, I thought I'd be working in the fashion industry for sure. That... quickly changed.</p>
