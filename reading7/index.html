		<h2>Response</h2>
        <p>DIY has so many meanings. I could indicate starting a project or writing from scratch or taking a personal twist on preexisting work. On Github (or on other sites too), written code is so public that it can easily be plagiarised. This gives people the power to create a site so complex yet so similar to others. Is it right to do? No, but I guess it almost falls under the term DIY or <q>handmade</q>.
        </p>
        <p>As more and more creatives are learning to code, finding a true handmade web is not rare but I guess more unique and desired. There's nothing wrong with using a template, but that's allowing a company to to maintain <b>your</b> work. It's less personalized and easier to setup and having a website doesn't become your own work anymore. I liked the reference of making a handmade page to be like making a zine or other printed materials. That you can't copy and paste.
